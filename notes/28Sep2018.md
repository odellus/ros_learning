I need to work more on getting plants loaded into Gazebo and all of that jazz. I'm somewhat familiar with Gazebo since I've already done most of the ROS in 5 Days. I just keep coming up against the building block that I want to be able to run all of the demos from ROS in 5 Days locally. So that's what these notes are going to be about. Getting ROS in 5 Days to work locally.


 The first lecture is about the basics of ROS and it uses the turtlebot. And when I say basics I mean like controlling a turtlebot with the keyboard with  

 `roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch`  

and then going over things like the basic structure of a package

```
package directory
|--launch directory: Contains launch files
|--src directory: Source files (cpp, python)
|--CMakeLists.txt: List of cmake rules for compilation
|--package.xml: Package information and dependencies
```

Then they show you a basic launch file after having you `roscd turtlebot_teleop`
```xml
<launch>
  <!-- turtlebot_teleop_key already has its own built in velocity smoother -->
  <node pkg="turtlebot_teleop" type="turtlebot_teleop_key.py" name="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard"  output="screen">
    <param name="scale_linear" value="0.5" type="double"/>
    <param name="scale_angular" value="1.5" type="double"/>
    <remap from="turtlebot_teleop_keyboard/cmd_vel" to="/cmd_vel"/>   <!-- cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop"/-->
  </node>
</launch>
```

Then they go through the steps of creating your own package from scratch with

```bash
roscd
cd ..
pwd # To show where catkin_ws is on the filesystem.
cd src
catkin_create_pkg my_package rospy
```
and outline the structure of the command with  
`catkin_create_pkg <package_name> <package_dependecies>`



```bash
rospack list
rospack list | grep my_package
roscd my_package
```
