I'm going to start using nano instead of atom since I don't need to have x-server working to use nano. Or maybe I won't not sure.

I started going through the ROS basics with the TurtleBot3 instead of the orginal TurtleBot because the old turtlebot was causing gzserver to crash and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. So I just added a "3" to the end of all the occurences of "turtlebot" in the ROS Basics tutorial. Well I haven't done it all yet, but I did get the `turtlebot3_teleop_keyboard` package working after spinning up `roscore` and `turtlebot3_gazebo`.
